# Apple or tomatoes image classification
This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify images of apples and tomatoes accurately. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model learns to differentiate between the two fruits based on their visual features. The dataset consists of various images of apples and tomatoes in different lighting conditions, orientations, and backgrounds. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/apples-or-tomatoes-image-classification

## Key points 
**Task**
Develop a deep learning-based classification model in a small dataset to distinguish between images of apples and tomatoes 

**Approach:**
Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
Preprocess images through resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model generalization.
Train the model using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) with a labeled dataset of apples and tomatoes.
Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization.
